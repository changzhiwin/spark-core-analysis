# Set Spark environment variables for your site in this file. Some useful
# variables to set are:
# - MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY, to point to your Mesos native library (libmesos.so)
# - SCALA_HOME, to point to your Scala installation
# - SPARK_CLASSPATH, to add elements to Spark's classpath
# - SPARK_JAVA_OPTS, to add JVM options
# - SPARK_MEM, to change the amount of memory used per node (this should
#   be in the same format as the JVM's -Xmx option, e.g. 300m or 1g).
# - SPARK_LIBRARY_PATH, to add extra search paths for native libraries.
